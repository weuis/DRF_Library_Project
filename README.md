# üìö DRF Library Project

> A modern backend solution for managing library operations using Django REST Framework.

## üöÄ Overview

The DRF Library Project is an API-driven backend application that digitizes and automates the operations of a traditional library. It replaces outdated manual tracking of books, borrowings, users, and payments with a fully functional web-based system, designed for performance, scalability, and ease of use.

This project was developed as a technical assessment simulation and focuses on clean architecture, authentication, API design, and test coverage.
